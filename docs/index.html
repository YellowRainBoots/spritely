Spritely is a simple grid-based animation framework
with a text mode.  It was written for an introductory
OO programming course.

This package provides a framework for showing an animated grid of 
equal-size tiles, which is a limited form of sprite animation.  
It was written for educational purposes in an introductory OO
class.  It has a few unique features:
<ul>
<li>It strives to be as simple as possible, so as to not overload
    students with language features, unfamiliar idioms, or complex
    code to read through.

<li>It does <em>not</em> force the student to do all their work via
    callbacks, as is typical for GUIs.  The student is presented with
    a single-threaded model, where they ask the frame to display each
    animation frame.

<li>It allows programs to be run in text mode, using character-based
    graphics.  This allows students to do their development on a
    remote server via ssh, so they don't have to do system
    administration on their personal computer, like installing
    a Java environment, setting the CLASSPATH, or installing an X server.

<li>It restricts the user to equal-sized tiles.  This is more or less
    necessary to enable character mode.

<li>It handles the needed logic to maintain a given frame rate.  It
    handles the case where a program is suspended and woken back up,
    by moving the notion of time forward.

<li>It features simple callbacks for mouse clicks and key typed events,
    and it simulates these events in text mode.
</ul>
